Lists of domains to use as blocklists (or allowlists) in [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) for DNS blocking and filtering.

### These are my personal blocklists
I try to keep the as lightweight as possible. They block most ads and trackers from the websites and apps I most frequently use.
These lists have a focus on Canadian, Québécois, and French language websites.
